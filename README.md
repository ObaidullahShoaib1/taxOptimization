# Income Tax Optimization Tool

## üìã Problem Statement

In many tax systems, the tax burden on a single individual with a high income can be disproportionately large due to progressive tax slabs. However, if the total income is distributed among multiple individuals (e.g., family members or business partners), the total tax liability can be reduced because each person benefits from lower tax rates on their portion of the income.

This project provides a simple tool to demonstrate and calculate how dividing a total income among several individuals can optimize (reduce) the overall tax burden compared to when a single person reports the entire income.

## üöÄ Features

- Calculates tax for a single individual holding the entire income.
- Calculates tax when the income is optimally distributed among multiple individuals.
- Shows the tax saved through income splitting.
- User-friendly and responsive interface with a clean design.
